## Objective
The main objective of this project is to create an API to manage the loan payments control system from a fintech.

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to implement a solution given an abstract problem. You may find a problem in the asked task that you need to explain the problem and propose a solution to fix it.

## Problem
A fin-tech needs to create and manage the clients and keep track of the amount of money loaned and the missed/made payments. It also needs a place to retrieve the volume of outstanding debt at some point in time.

## Business Rules

*If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all without missing any payment, you can decrease by 0.02% his tax rate.
*If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed until 3 monthly payments, you can increase by 0.04% his tax rate.
*If a client contracted a loan in the past and paid all but missed more than 3 monthly payments or didnâ€™t pay all the loan, you need to deny the new one.


## Limitations
Loans are paid back in monthly installments.
